# Music Genre Classification

Aim of this project is to create machine learning models that will predict the genre of a given music file.

### Abstract

Categorizing music files according to their genre is a challenging and important task that is used by many music streaming services. Even though there are no sharp differences between music genres, the genre of the music can be determined according to certain dynamics.

### Methodology

We used various Python packages in this project: [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) for feature extraction, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visual content (graphs, plots, etc.), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, and finally [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/) for machine learning models.
